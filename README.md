# Secrets-App

Aug 2022 

A simplified Whisper App Clone to practice various levels of authentication.

Users are able to login with their email of Google account to creat an account to view the secrets submitted and anonymously submit their own.

- Frontend: EJS and Bootstrap
- Backend: Express with Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose

This is not currenly deployed. 

This was a really cool learning process. Learning the actual authentication process was really eye opening. We worked through the levels of authentication starting with just basic email & password saving, hashin, salt & hashing, and ending with the passport.js and OAuth. I always knew there was a lot that went into that but working through each step was really cool and made me appreciate it more. 

This was the first time working with and fully understanding process.env."VARIABLES", I had gone down a google whole trying to figure this out more in the newsletter and to-do list and I got partially there but never figured out the .env files fully and it was really satifying to finally understand that more  than just a "I know this is important" type moment. 

The CSS and some of the partial pages are importaed from the bootcamp I am in we were working specifcally on authentication so they provided us with some starter files.
